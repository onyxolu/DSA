# Sometimes we receive a single field that is meant to contain a handful of identifiers. Partners intend it to be comma separated, but what shows up can vary. Extra spaces slip in, empty positions appear, and a few entries look like they were half typed. We still need to turn that into something our internal tools can use.

# Internally we track which identifiers are actually recognized. Exact matches are preferred, yet there are cases where an incoming token is only the start of something we know. For example, a short form like t2 may line up with one or more records that begin with that text. We want to reflect that relationship without guessing beyond what the data supports.

# Downstream consumers expect a result that is easy to act on. Not just a bag of strings, but a small summary that tells them what was good, what was not, and where partial alignment occurred.

# Now let us stage the work in steps.

# Step 1
# Take the raw string and turn it into a clean list. Trim whitespace, ignore blanks, keep the original order.

# Step 2
# Compare that list to a provided set of recognized identifiers, return only the ones that are recognized, keep the same order.

# Step 3
# For each input token, find any recognized identifiers that begin with that token. Report all such pairs.

# Step 4
# Produce a structured summary per input token, with one of three outcomes: valid, invalid, or prefix of something valid, plus any matched targets where relevant.
