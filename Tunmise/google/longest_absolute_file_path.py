# Intuition
# Directories has a hierarchy type of relation, so we can use stack to simulate the process.
# Explanations
# For each dir or file, we store 2 things in stack
# current total length (including parent and '/'), depth (how many '\t' to reach this subdir)
# If stack is empty, we add new tuple
# If deepest dir or file in stack (stack[-1]) is at the same or deeper depth of current path
# pop stack until stack[-1] (or empty stack) is shallower than depth of path
# Add tuple and cumulate the total length
# If name has . then it's a file path and we can compare it with ans to get the longest.

    def lengthLongestPath(self, s: str) -> int:
        paths, stack, ans = s.split('\n'), [], 0
        for path in paths:
            p = path.split('\t')
            depth, name = len(p) - 1, p[-1]
            l = len(name)
            while stack and stack[-1][1] >= depth: stack.pop()
            if not stack: stack.append((l, depth))
            else: stack.append((l+stack[-1][0], depth))
            if '.' in name: ans = max(ans, stack[-1][0] + stack[-1][1])   
        return ans
